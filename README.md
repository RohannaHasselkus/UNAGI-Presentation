This repository contains a presentation prepared for a scientific conference that explains gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and demonstrates how the UNAGI algorithm works.

The slides include:
- An introduction to gene regulatory networks
- Key concepts behind the UNAGI algorithm
- Visualizations of network inference and analysis

This presentation is intended for an audience with a background in any science, not just computational biology. Please access my presentation with this link:
